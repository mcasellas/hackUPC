# HackUPC Winter 2017
Our project for the HackUPC Winter 2017.

## The plan
The plan for this hackathon is to implement a Matlab program to an Arduino, well... to a cloned board.

## Team
- [@mrrobb][1] - Matlab programming
- [@mcasellas][2] - Arduino compatibility
- [@XxerixX][3] - 3D design

# And then…

After some Nerf battles, waffles and more...

The Game happened.

Basically it was a contest where the best programmers from those 500 participants tried to solve some arduous, exhausting and mentally-expensive problems.

So… I left my project apart and I focused on trying to win The Game.

Here is the result:
